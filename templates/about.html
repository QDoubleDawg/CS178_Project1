            <p><strong>College is stressful enough. Finding the stuff you need (or getting rid of what you don’t) shouldn’t be.</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to <strong>CampusCart</strong>—your one-stop campus marketplace built <em>by students, for students</em>. Whether you’re hunting down a last-minute textbook, trying to furnish your off-campus apartment on a ramen budget, or finally ready to part ways with that neon mini fridge, CampusCart makes buying and selling simple, sustainable, and local.</p>

            <p>We know what it’s like to pay $120 for a book you’ll use for three weeks. We’ve lived the struggle of finding a cheap futon, only to have to haul it across town. CampusCart was created to make those headaches a thing of the past.</p>

            <p>Here, everything stays on campus—or at least close to it. No more sketchy meetups in a Walmart parking lot or paying for shipping that costs more than the item itself. We’re all about keeping the exchange between students, classmates, and dorm neighbors. You post, you connect, you deal—it’s that easy.</p>

            <p>But we’re more than just a marketplace. We’re a community of students supporting students. Every transaction helps reduce waste, save money, and give new life to the things that make college a little more manageable (and a lot more livable).</p>

            <p>So whether you’re a freshman decorating your first dorm, a senior offloading furniture before graduation, or somewhere in between—CampusCart is here to help you save cash, cut clutter, and make connections.</p>

            <p class="font-italic text-center mt-4">
                <strong>Less waste. More wallet. Only students. Always campus.</strong><br>
                This is <strong>CampusCart</strong>. Let’s keep college moving forward, one used item at a time.
